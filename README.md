### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### What I learned

I learned how to setup my forms in this project. I set up all of my styles in my parent element which was the form tag. This allowed me to easily change the class and add styles to my project. These are a few examples taken from my code to show how I managed to display styles after hitting the submit button.

```HTML
<form class="form" id="form">

        <div class="form-control">
          <input type="text" placeholder="First Name" id="firstname">
          <i class="fas fa-check-circle fa-lg"></i>
          <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle fa-lg"></i>
          <small>Error message</small>
        </div>
        <!-- .... -->
</form>

```

```Javascript
function setErrorFor(input, message) {
    const formControl = input.parentElement;
    //.form-control
    const small = formControl.querySelector('small');

    //add error message inside small
    small.innerText = message;

    //add error class
    formControl.className = 'form-control error';
}
```

```CSS
.form-control.success i.fa-check-circle {
	color: var(--green);
	visibility: visible;
}
```
